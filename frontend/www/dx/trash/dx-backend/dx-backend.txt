Sure, here are some more open source backend frameworks:

1. [Sinatra](^1^): Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.
2. [Meteor](^2^): Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.
3. [NestJS](^3^): NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
4. [Feathers](^4^): Feathers is a lightweight web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript.
5. [Sails.js](^5^): Sails.js makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.
6. [LoopBack](^6^): LoopBack is a highly extensible, open-source Node.js and TypeScript framework based on Express that enables you to quickly create APIs and microservices composed from backend systems such as databases and SOAP or REST services.
7. [Hapi](^7^): hapi is a simple to use configuration-centric framework with built-in support for input validation, caching, authentication, and other essential facilities for building web applications and services.
8. [Strapi](^8^): Strapi is the leading open-source headless CMS. It’s 100% JavaScript, fully customizable, and developer-first.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more information about any of these frameworks.
